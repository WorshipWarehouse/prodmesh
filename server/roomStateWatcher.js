//  ROOM MODE WATCHER  —  one Companion poller per room, not one per browser.
//
//  `GET /api/rooms/:id/state` reads the Companion custom variable on every
//  request and caches nothing, and each RoomCard polled it on its own interval.
//  Home showing six rooms in three browsers was therefore 54 Companion reads a
//  minute for six facts. As a dashboard grid this only gets worse: every widget
//  that wants to know a room's mode would add another loop.
//
//  So mode becomes a topic. The hub starts this watcher when the first viewer
//  subscribes and stops it when the last leaves, and the room is read once per
//  cycle no matter how many are watching. The REST endpoint stays as it is —
//  it is a single read, and mock rooms and one-off checks still want it.
//
//  Published on CHANGE, not on every poll, so an idle room costs one small
//  Companion request per cycle and no traffic at all to the browsers.
