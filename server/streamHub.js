//  STREAM HUB  —  one SSE connection per browser, many topics.
//
//  Every live datum in the app used to ride one per-room stream carrying one
//  fixed envelope (showManager's `state` event). That shape has two ceilings a
//  dashboard grid would hit immediately:
//
//    • Per-room streams don't compose. A wall display showing six rooms needs
//      six EventSources, and browsers allow only SIX concurrent connections per
//      origin on HTTP/1.1. This is a LAN appliance with no TLS and therefore no
//      HTTP/2 (see the threat model in CLAUDE.md), so that limit is real: the
//      sixth stream simply never opens, silently, and the page half-works.
//    • A fixed envelope can't grow. Every new datum widens one object that then
//      ships to every subscriber whether their widgets render it or not.
//
//  So: a browser opens ONE connection and names the topics it wants.
//
//  The property worth preserving from the old design is watcher refcounting —
//  ProPresenter is not polled for a room nobody is looking at. That is what
//  `start`/`stop` are: the hub calls `start` when a topic gains its first
//  subscriber and `stop` when it loses its last. Feature modules register the
//  topics they own; the hub knows nothing about rooms.
//
//  Wire format: `event: msg`, data `{ topic, data }`. One event name rather
//  than one per topic, so the client attaches a single listener and routes.

 *                      value, and nothing at all if the topic went idle — the
 *                      retained value is dropped when the producer stops, since
 *                      it is by then stale by definition. Any topic whose state
 *                      outlives its viewers (a show runs whether or not anyone
 *                      is watching) therefore needs a snapshot.

//  value is an unauthenticated memory-exhaustion vector — /api/stream needs no
//  auth, so a client that connects and simply never reads is two lines of
//  socket code. The benign version is commoner: a booth Mac that sleeps, or a
//  tab on a stalled link, while SPL publishes about once a second per room.
//
//  The answer is conflation rather than a queue, and it is correct HERE
//  specifically because every topic carries a STATE SNAPSHOT — "the mode is X",
//  "loudness is now Y". A client only ever renders the newest value, so
//  dropping superseded ones costs nothing and the final state is still right.
//  Memory is then bounded by design: at most one pending frame per topic per
//  connection, and topics per connection are already capped.
//
//  This does NOT hold for event-shaped topics — "a cue fired", "an alert was
//  raised" — where a superseded value is a lost event. Nothing publishes one
//  today; anything that does needs its own path, not this one.
