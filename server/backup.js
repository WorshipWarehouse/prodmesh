//  BACKUP & RESTORE  —  one file that carries an installation.
//
//  For the person who set prodmesh up once and does not want to do it again
//  when the machine dies. So it has to restore into something USABLE: the
//  Planning Center token, the PINs, the users. Which means the file is as
//  sensitive as the server itself, and everything here is arranged around
//  that being true rather than around pretending it is not.
//
//  Two facts shape the format.
//
//  1. COPYING prodmesh.db WHILE THE SERVER RUNS PRODUCES A CORRUPT BACKUP.
//     WAL means recent commits live in `-wal`, not in the `.db` file, so a
//     plain copy is a database missing its newest transactions — and it fails
//     silently, which is the worst way for a backup to fail. `VACUUM INTO`
//     writes a consistent single-file snapshot from a live database. That is
//     the only correct way to do this and it is not the obvious one.
//
//  2. THE HISTORY IS 99% OF THE BYTES AND ALMOST NONE OF THE VALUE. Measured
//     on a real installation: 164,496 of ~170,000 rows were SPL samples, and
//     the database was 16 MB. Everything a person would grieve — rooms,
//     integrations, users, permissions, dashboards, checklists — came to about
//     450 rows and tens of kilobytes. So history is opt-in, and the default
//     backup is small enough that nobody thinks twice about taking one.
