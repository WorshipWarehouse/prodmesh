//  ROOM INTEGRATION HEALTH  —  one prober per room, not one per screen.
//
//  Same probe as the chips on Admin → Campuses → a room (connectivityStatus's
//  roomStatus), so a green dot here and a green chip there mean the same
//  thing: the smallest real request the dashboard depends on came back.
//
//  Two things make it safe to publish on an UNAUTHENTICATED topic when the
//  route that shares the probe needs `config.manage`:
//
//   1. REFCOUNTING. The hub starts this when the first screen subscribes and
//      stops it when the last leaves, and a room is probed once per cycle
//      however many are watching. The route is gated because each REQUEST
//      generates outbound traffic to the building's devices; here a wall of
//      displays costs exactly what one costs. That is the same property that
//      already makes the mode watcher (4s) and the SPL watcher (1s) safe, and
//      this cycle is far slower than either.
//
//   2. REDACTION. The published value says WHICH integration and WHETHER it
//      works. It never carries a host, a port, a version banner or an error
//      string. Those are the difference between "ProPresenter is down" and a
//      map of the building's network, and probe text is full of them:
//      proPresenter.ping returns the PP machine's own host description, and a
//      failed TCP connect stringifies as "ECONNREFUSED 10.x.y.z:1025".
//      companion.ping already learned this the hard way — see the comment
//      there about reporting the shape of an answer and not its bytes. The
//      detail is not lost, it is just kept where it was already: the config
//      chips and Admin → Logs, both behind a permission.
//
//  Published on CHANGE, so a healthy room costs one probe per cycle and no
//  browser traffic at all.
