//  STREAM STORE  —  YouTube Live viewer counts captured while a show is live.
//
//  Sibling of splStore.js, same instanceId key (planId__timeId), so the Show
//  Report can join timing, loudness and viewership.
//
//  Worth remembering why this table exists at all: YouTube reports
//  `concurrentViewers` only DURING a broadcast and discards it afterwards. If
//  we don't write it down as it happens, the number is gone. That makes these
//  rows the primary record, not a cache of something recoverable — which is
//  why retention is generous and the aggregate is copied into show_summaries
//  before samples are ever pruned.
