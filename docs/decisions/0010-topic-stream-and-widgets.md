# 0010 — One topic stream per browser

Status: accepted (2026-08-03) · supersedes the per-room stream in [0004](0004-server-coordinated-shows.md)

## Context

Run of Show was fed by one SSE endpoint per room, `/api/rooms/:id/show/stream`,
carrying a single fixed envelope: show state, current item, slide progress,
ProPresenter connectivity, the PP timer and SPL, all in one `state` event. For
one page looking at one room that was the right shape, and it worked.

1.5 wants custom Dashboard views: a stored grid of widgets, potentially
spanning rooms and campuses, that a church lays out for a wall display or a
booth screen. Three properties of the old design make that impossible rather
than merely awkward:

1. **Per-room streams don't compose.** A view of six rooms means six
   `EventSource`s. Browsers allow **six concurrent connections per origin on
   HTTP/1.1**, and prodmesh is a LAN appliance with no TLS and therefore no
   HTTP/2 — that is a deliberate part of the threat model, not an oversight.
   So the limit is real and unfixable at this layer: the sixth stream never
   opens, silently, and the page half-works with no error anywhere.

2. **A fixed envelope can't grow.** YouTube Live viewers, on-air state and
   whatever 1.5 brings would each widen one struct that then ships to every
   subscriber, whether or not their widgets render it. A slide change would
   re-send the loudness meter.

3. **Everything outside Run of Show polled independently.** Each `RoomCard`
   ran its own interval firing three requests, and `readRoomState()` reads
   Companion with no cache — so Home showing six rooms in three browsers was
   54 Companion reads a minute for six facts. A twelve-widget grid inherits
   that multiplication.

What the old design got right, and which had to survive: **watcher
refcounting**. Subscribing started the room's PP-timer and SPL watchers;
the last disconnect stopped them. Nobody polls ProPresenter for a room nobody
is looking at.

## Decision

One SSE connection per browser tab, carrying named topics.

- **`server/streamHub.js`** owns topics. A feature module claims a pattern with
  `registerTopic('room:*:spl', { valid, start, stop, snapshot })`. The hub
  refcounts subscribers and calls `start` on the first and `stop` on the last —
  the old lifecycle, generalized and hoisted out of the show manager.
- **`GET /api/stream?topics=a,b,c`** emits `{ topic, data }` frames. `valid`
  refuses topics naming an unknown room: subscribing *starts work*, so an
  unauthenticated endpoint that accepts any string is a resource-exhaustion
  primitive. Invalid topics are dropped individually rather than failing the
  connection — one stale widget in a saved dashboard must not blank the other
  eleven.
- **The room's state is three topics, not one envelope**: `room:<id>:show`,
  `room:<id>:timer`, `room:<id>:spl`, plus the new `room:<id>:mode`. A widget
  that wants only loudness no longer makes the server poll PP's timers.
- **`src/lib/stream.ts`** holds the single connection. `useTopic(topic)` is the
  push-side companion to `useQuery`: it refcounts topics across mounts and
  reconnects — debounced — when the set changes. Twelve widgets mounting
  together open one connection, not twelve.
- **`room:<id>:mode` is new.** One Companion poller per room regardless of how
  many screens watch it, published on change. `bump()` after a mode press
  pushes immediately, so every screen in the building moves together instead
  of each discovering it on its own interval.

- **Slow subscribers conflate, they never queue.** `res.write()` returns false
  once the socket buffer is full and Node then buffers without bound, so
  ignoring it makes an unauthenticated endpoint a memory-exhaustion vector —
  and more mundanely, a booth Mac that sleeps costs the server memory for as
  long as it sleeps. Under backpressure the hub keeps at most **one pending
  frame per topic per connection**, newest wins, flushed on `drain`. This is
  correct *because every topic carries a state snapshot*: a client only ever
  renders the newest value, so superseded ones cost nothing to drop and the
  final state is still right. It would be wrong for an event-shaped topic
  ("a cue fired"), where a superseded value is a lost event — nothing
  publishes one today, and anything that does needs its own path.
- **One serialization per publish**, not one per subscriber. Irrelevant at
  three browsers; decisive if devices ever publish metrics at rate to several
  dashboards.

`/api/rooms/:id/show/stream` **stays**, reimplemented as an adapter over the
same three topics. Room-Mac homepages and bookmarks point at views that use it,
and it is the one URL an operator can open raw to see whether the server is
alive. Being an adapter rather than a parallel implementation means the two
surfaces cannot drift.

## Consequences

- A dashboard of any size costs one connection. The six-connection ceiling
  stops being reachable.
- New live data is a new topic and a registration — no existing subscriber's
  payload changes.
- Home stops polling Companion per card per browser, and mode changes appear
  immediately rather than up to 30s later.
- The client's live data now has two mechanisms — `useQuery` for request/
  response, `useTopic` for push. That is a real cost in things-to-know, paid
  for by the fact that they compose: `RoomStatus` takes its first paint from
  `useQuery` and every subsequent value from `useTopic`, so the page never
  shows a spinner waiting for a socket.
- Tests need an `EventSource`, which jsdom lacks. It is stubbed globally in
  `src/test/setup.ts` so a component growing a live topic doesn't break the
  tests of whatever renders it.
- `streamHub.reset()` drops *all* registrations, so hub unit tests and tests
  that boot the app must live in different files (`streamHub.test.js` vs
  `streamApi.test.js`) — the usual one-process-per-boot-state rule.

## The widget registry (added 2026-08-04)

`src/widgets/registry.tsx` mirrors `src/tiles/registry.tsx` — the pattern that
already works here. A widget type is one entry plus one component.

The load-bearing constraint is the **props contract**: a widget receives
`{ roomId, config }` and nothing else. A stored layout is data, so a widget can
only be placed from data if it can get everything it needs from data. Which
means widgets fetch their own state instead of receiving it as props.

That reads like duplicated work and isn't, provided both sides use the same
cache key — hence `src/lib/keys.ts`. Subscriptions refcount through `useTopic`;
requests share through `useQuery`. Verified on the live Run of Show page: one
`/api/stream` carrying exactly `show`, `spl`, `timer`, and one plan request
serving both the page and its countdown. Getting this wrong is silent — a
mismatched key doesn't break anything, it just doubles the request — which is
why the keys are centralized rather than spelled out per call site.

**Not everything on a screen is a widget.** Run of Show's Start/End/Prev/Next
stays a page component: no dashboard would place it, and giving it a config
contract would be inventing a requirement to satisfy a pattern. The registry
holds `countdown` and `loudness`, which are genuinely relocatable — the
countdown follows the room's next service when no plan is pinned, so a lobby
screen doesn't need reconfiguring weekly.

Run of Show renders through the registry rather than importing the components,
deliberately: it is the first consumer of the path a stored layout will take,
so a wrong contract is wrong there first.

Spans became arbitrary 1–12 columns (`.widgets` was already `repeat(12, 1fr)`);
`half`/`third`/`two-thirds` remain aliases. `spanColumns()` range-checks even
though `WidgetSpan` says it can't need to — spans arrive from the database,
where the type is a promise nothing has enforced.

## Not decided here

Stored dashboard layouts: the schema, the editor, and how a layout is scoped to
a room or campus. This ADR is the transport and the component contract they
will need; the layout model is its own decision.

## Known limits, if devices ever publish into this

The transport generalizes to non-room producers — a Pi, a server, Dante
Director — becoming topics like `device:<id>:cpu`. Two things would need
revisiting first, neither of them a redesign:

- **`MAX_TOPICS` is 64 per connection**, sized for a page of widgets. A
  metrics wall of fifty devices with several series each blows past it.
- **Subscription is by exact topic.** A metrics dashboard would rather say
  `device:*:temp` than enumerate. Wildcard subscription is a hub-side change;
  the refcount would then key on the resolved topic, not the pattern.

Ingest (how a device gets a value *in*) and whether SQLite is the right store
for high-rate metrics are separate questions this ADR does not touch.
